        <div class="subheading mb-5">History MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Marco Trujillo Ramos, I am the oldest of four children, and I am the first of my family to attend college. Iâ€™ve always had an interest in history and helping others, in high school I was always attentive and tried to participate in many clubs. I played many sports as well, like track and tennis, which is where my interest for athletics came from, but my education was always an important factor. Clubs always sparked an interest for me, one of which was the schoolâ€™s spanish club where I helped in any way I could, organizing events or just participating in events. In the academic field I made sure to take part in some classes that really challenged me, one of which was the AP U.S. History class. It peaked my interest in history and allowed me to pursue an education revolving around the history of the U.S. during the 20th century, which is what I hope to study at UCR.<br><br>

        One of my very first jobs involved working with my father in demolition, in the company known as Ultimate Removal, Inc. The job involved clearing the inside of buildings, like taking off drywall  and electric wiring. The first time I worked with him was during sophomore year in summer, where my father needed some extra help. At first I didnâ€™t have a lot of responsibilities there, my job mainly consisted of taking all the trash from the floors to a large trash dumpster. As I got older I obtained more responsibilities, and this job was one of the first ones that taught me the truth of hard working labor. The next job I obtained was from my own ability, I became an AVID tutor at my old high school, Canyon Springs. I knew about the job two years prior and was very intrigued by it. While I was working there I interacted with many of my old teachers and the same time I was able to look at high school from a different point of view. I tutored kids in AVID, math classes that ranged from freshman to junior, to even some spanish classes. Although I haven't had a whole year there, it's a very rewarding job, it has its moments where you can have some fun but also times where you actually have to work. With each month I learn more and more while I'm there, allowing me to work at the best of my ability.<br><br>

        With all these experiences I hope to push through and obtain a greater goal, my dream career. With my past jobs I enjoyed not only moving around but also helping others with the best of my ability. After I hopefully get my bachelors degree in history, I plan to attend a police academy and become a sworn police officer of Los Angeles. History peaked my interest in high school, but being a police officer was a dream of mine, since a very young age. As time passed, I set my sights on being a police detective, after finishing college at UCR, I can set my sights on my goal, and obtain what Iâ€™ve always desired.
